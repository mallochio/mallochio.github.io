This is a list of some resources I used for courses or sessions over the years.

1. <ins>Pytorch for machine learning and computational graph building.</ins>

    I taught a week-long course for doctoral students at TU Eindhoven for  [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) from the ground up. Here's a [link](https://gitlab.com/mallochio/Pytorch-tutorials) to the repository containing the Jupyter notebooks I used for teaching. 


2. <ins>Generating post-hoc explanations for neural networks through concept mapping.</ins>

    Here's a [link](https://siddharth.ai/assets/pdf/Concept-mapping.pdf) to the slides I used for my presentation at the Benelux AI conference (BNAIC), 2018. The topic was on concept-mapping, a technique I created that constructs mappings between feature layers of neural networks and interpretable knowledge comprised on input features.


3. <ins>Struc2vec - Learning Node Representations from Structural Identity </ins> 

    Here's a [link](https://siddharth.ai/assets/pdf/struc2vec.pdf) to slides I used for a presentation I gave at a machine learning meetup in the Netherlands, on the topic of struc2vec, a node embedding technique that takes into account the structural identity of nodes.


4. <ins>Computational intelligence</ins>

    I also was the teaching assistant for a year for `TI2736A Computational intelligence', a course at TU Delft. I helped in designing and grading assignments, and helped students with their lab work.

### Volunteering

I also volunteered as a English and mathematics teacher for underprivileged high school students at schools in Mumbai for the 2014-15 academic year, through the Make a Difference foundation.
