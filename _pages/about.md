<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Edit: This blog is a work in progress. Thanks for visiting.!

I'm a machine learning researcher from the Netherlands.

I am an expert at solving hard problems relating to machine learning and AI. I'm a pragmatist, and I don't think that throwing complex AI models at all of the world's problems is a viable solution. On the other hand, there is most probably a useful AI method that could benefit your use-case, complex or otherwise. 

I try to read a lot of books in my free time, and I log most of it on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22339774-siddharth-ravi). I'm particularly into the writings of [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194805.Understanding_Power?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=g5McUTzLFO&rank=5) at the moment of writing this.

I also used to be active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Siddharth-Ravi-2). I even got a *Top Writer* tag a couple of years back along with some cool swag. I stopped when I realized that my algorithmically generated feed, however much I try to optimize it, is more of a distraction than anything else and that my time was better spent elsewhere.  Now I try to be more of a [digital minimalist](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/18/on-digital-minimalism/), more to cultivate concentration than anything else. Hence the creation of this site and associated blog.

I like playing quizzes in my free time. My quiz winnings pretty much helped pay my way through university, and I've won at events both at the state and national levels. I am also into debating, and I've done debates throughout my university years. I've won a lot of awards for public speaking and debating at the national level over the years.

Feel free to reach out, I'd love to connect with like-minded individuals.

-Siddharth
