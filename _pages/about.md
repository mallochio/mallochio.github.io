Edit: This site is a work in progress. Thanks for visiting.!

I'm a machine learning researcher from the Netherlands.

I am an expert at solving hard problems relating to machine learning and AI. I'm a pragmatist, and I have gathered enough real world experience to know that throwing complex AI models at all of the world's problems is not a viable solution. On the other hand, there is most probably a useful AI method that could benefit your use-case, complex or otherwise. Automation, on the whole is most definitely a good thing.

I currently work as a machine learning research engineer at Q-Free, a large Norwegian tech company where I create deep learning based object detectors and segmenters to solve interesting and hard problems relating to traffic. Prior to that, I was a researcher at Tilburg university working on interpretable machine learning models. Previously I have created machine learning and statistical models for companies like Ernst and Young and Toyota.

Other non-work stuff about me - 

* I try to read a lot of books in my free time, and I log most of it on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22339774-siddharth-ravi). I'm particularly into the writings of [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194805.Understanding_Power?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=g5McUTzLFO&rank=5). Goodreads tells me that I read slightly more than one book a week last year, so that's real nice. :)

* I used to be active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Siddharth-Ravi-2). I even got a *Top Writer* tag a couple of years back along with some cool swag. I stopped when I realized that my algorithmically generated feed, however much I try to optimize it, is more of a distraction than anything else and that my time was better spent elsewhere.  Now I try to be more of a [digital minimalist](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/18/on-digital-minimalism/), more to cultivate concentration than anything else. Hence the creation of this site and associated blog.

* I used to be a competitive quiz player before I became an engineer, and I like playing quizzes in my free time. My quiz winnings pretty much helped pay my way through university, and I've won at events both at the state and national levels. 

* I am also into debating, and I've done debates throughout my university years. I've won a lot of awards for public speaking and debating at the national level over many years.

* I also longboard and cycle a whole lot.

Feel free to reach out, I'd love to connect with like-minded individuals.
